# Stremlit-Demo

This project features more than 5k TV Shows from the last century, found in *Netflix, Prime, Disney+* & *Hulu*, into an interactive Streamlit app. You will be able to compare and filter all TV Shows, as well as the platforms with insightful visualizations.

The complete demo is implemented in less than 300 lines of Python and illustrates all the major building blocks of Streamlit.

# How to run the demo:
```
pip install --upgrade streamlit opencv-python
streamlit run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Josep-at-work/Streamlit-Demo/master/streamlit_app.py
